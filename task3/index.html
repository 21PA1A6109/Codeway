                <p>The Boss 429 is a muscle car produced in limited numbers in 1969 and 1970. Its origin is twofold: allow Ford to homologate its new Ford 385 engine-based semi-hemispherical 429 V8 for NASCAR racing, and to provide a big block alternative to the 5.0 L and under Trans Am Racing bred small block Boss 302 Mustang.</p>

                <p>The Mustang Boss 302 is a high-performance 302 cu in (4.9 L) H.O. V8-powered variant of the Ford Mustang originally produced by Ford in 1969 and 1970. Developed to meet homologation requirements to compete in Trans Am racing, it was Ford's response to the success of the Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 in the 5 L (305.1 cu in) and under SCCA series since 1967. While substantial modifications were required to the stock Boss 302 to be competitive on the track, many thousands were sold to the public in a street-legal form that included a refined high-performance motor and upgrades to the suspension and brakes over base Mustangs</p>

                <p>Introduced in the autumn of 1969 for the 1970 model year,[2] the Challenger was one of two Chrysler E-body cars, the other being the slightly smaller Plymouth Barracuda. Positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car market segment,[3] it was "a rather late response" to the Ford Mustang, which debuted in April 1964.</p>
